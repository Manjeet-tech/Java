## __1. GCD FOR STRINGS__
#### For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + ... + t (i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).

#### Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and str2.

#### Example 1:
Input: str1 = "ABCABC", str2 = "ABC"
Output: "ABC"
#### Example 2:
Input: str1 = "ABABAB", str2 = "ABAB"
Output: "AB"
#### Example 3:
Input: str1 = "LEET", str2 = "CODE"
Output: ""

## __Idea__
```
The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that can divide both of them without leaving any remainder. For example, the GCD of 12 and 18 is 6, and the GCD of 17 and 23 is 1.

To find the GCD of two strings, we can use a similar idea. The GCD of two strings is the largest string that can divide both of them without leaving any remainder. For example, the GCD of “ababab” and “abab” is “ab”, and the GCD of “abc” and “def” is “” (empty string).
```
__Approach 1. Naive Method__

#### __Intuition:__
```
1. Use a loop to check all the possible substrings of the shorter string.
starting from the longest one, and see if it can divide both str1 and str2.

2.  This is very slow and inefficient, because it requires O (min (m, n)^2) time, where m and n are the lengths of str1 and str2 respectively.

3. We need to iterate over all the substrings of length min (m, n), which are min (m, n) in number, and each substring comparison takes O (min (m, n)) time.
```

#### __Algoritham:__

```
1. If either string is empty, return the other string.
2. Find the length of the shorter string.
3. Loop over all the substrings of the shorter string from longest to shortest.
4. Get the current substring, Check if it can divide both str1 and str2.
5. Create a Helper function to check if a string can be divided by another string:
    i. If s is empty, return true
    ii. If s starts with t, then recursively check the remaining part of s.
    iii. Otherwise, return false.
6. Otherwise, there is no common divisor return empty string.
```

#### __Code:__
```
public class Solution {
    // Function to find the GCD of two strings using naive method
    public String gcdOfStringsNaive(String str1, String str2) {
        // If either string is empty, return the other string
        if (str1.isEmpty()) return str2;
        if (str2.isEmpty()) return str1;

        // Find the length of the shorter string
        int len = Math.min(str1.length(), str2.length());

        // Loop over all the substrings of the shorter string from longest to shortest
        for (int i = len; i > 0; i--) {
            // Get the current substring
            String sub = str1.substring(0, i);

            // Check if it can divide both str1 and str2
            if (isDivisible(str1, sub) && isDivisible(str2, sub)) {
                // Return the substring as the GCD
                return sub;
            }
        }

        // Otherwise, there is no common divisor
        return "";
    }

    // Helper function to check if a string can be divided by another string
    public boolean isDivisible(String s, String t) {
        // If s is empty, return true
        if (s.isEmpty()) return true;

        // If s starts with t, then recursively check the remaining part of s
        if (s.startsWith(t)) {
            return isDivisible(s.substring(t.length()), t);
        }

        // Otherwise, return false
        return false;
    }
}

```
__Approach 2. Effective Method:: Euclidean algorithm__

#### __Intuition:__
```
1. The Euclidean algorithm is a way to find the GCD of two numbers by repeatedly applying the formula: GCD (a, b) = GCD (b, a mod b), where a mod b is the remainder when a is divided by b. The algorithm stops when b becomes zero, and returns a as the GCD.

2. To apply this idea to strings, we can use the formula: GCD (str1, str2) = GCD (str2, str1 - str2), where str1 - str2 is the difference between str1 and str2, which means removing the common prefix of str1 and str2. For example, if str1 = “ababab” and str2 = “abab”, then str1 - str2 = “ab”. The algorithm stops when either string becomes empty, and returns the other string as the GCD.

3. This method is much faster and more efficient than the naive method, because it requires O (max (m, n)) time, where m and n are the lengths of str1 and str2 respectively. This is because we only need to compare at most max (m, n) characters in total, as each recursive call reduces one of the strings by at least one character.
```

#### __Algoritham:__

```
1. If either of the strings is empty, return the other string as the GCD.
2. If the length of the first string is smaller than the second string, swap them.
3. If the first string starts with the second string, then recursively find the GCD of the second string and the remaining part of the first string after removing the prefix.
4. Otherwise, return “” as there is no common divisor.
```

#### __Code:__

```
public class Solution {
    // Function to find the GCD of two strings using Euclidean algorithm
    public String gcdOfStringsEuclid(String str1, String str2) {
        // If either string is empty, return the other string
        if (str1.isEmpty()) return str2;
        if (str2.isEmpty()) return str1;

        // If str1 starts with str2, then recursively find the GCD of str2 and
        // the remaining part of str1
        if (str1.startsWith(str2)) {
            return gcdOfStringsEuclid(str2, str1.substring(str2.length()));
        }

        // Otherwise, there is no common divisor
        return "";
    }
}
