## __4.Can Place Flowers__

#### You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

#### Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.

#### Example 1:
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1   
Output: true

#### Example 2:
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2   
Output: false

#### __Intuition__
```
 1. Iterate over the flowerbed array and check if each position is empty and has no adjacent flowers.
 2. If so, we can plant a flower there and increment counter.
 3. Compare counter >= n return true.
```

#### __Approach__
```
1. Create a counter as planter.
2. Iterate over the array, If the flowerbed is empty i.e 0.
3. Create prevEmpty to check previous flowerbed is empty.
    - when the 0th index is empty flowerbed.
    - when the prev i.e (current - 1) flowerbed is empty.
4. Create nextEmpty to check, If the next flowerbed is empty.
    - when the last index is empty flowerbed.
    - when the next (current + 1) flowerbed is empty.
5. Plant the flower at the position where:
    prevEmty && nextEmpty are true. and increment the plater counter.
6. return true planted counter >= n.
```

#### __CODE__
```
boolean canPlaceFlowers(int[] flowerbed,int n){

    int planter = 0;
    int len = flowerbed.length;

    for(int i=0;i<len;i++){

        if(flowerbed[i] == 0){
        boolean prevEmpty = i==0 || flowerbed[i-1]==0;
        boolean nextEmpty = i==len-1 || flowerbed[i+1] == 0;

        if(prevEmpty && nextEmpty){
            flowerbed[i] = 1;
            planter++;
        }
    }

    return planter>=n;
    }
}
```


#### __Observation__
```
Time COmplexity = O(n)
Space Complexity = O(1)
```
