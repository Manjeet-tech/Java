## __3.Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies__

#### There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies, where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has, and an integer extraCandies, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.

####  Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.

####  Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

#### Example 1:
Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 

#### Example 2:

Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
Output: [true,false,false,false,false]

#### __Intuition__
```
To find if a kid with extraCandies can have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, we need to first find the maximum number of candies among all the kids, and then check if adding extraCandies to the candies of a kid results in a value greater than or equal to the maximum number of candies. If it does, then the kid can have the greatest number of candies among all the kids.
```

#### __Approach__
```
1. Find the maximum number of candies among all the kids by iterating through the candies array.

2. Iterate through the candies array again and check for each kid if they can have the greatest number of candies by adding extraCandies to their candies and comparing it to the maximum number of candies.

3. If it is greater than or equal to the maximum number of candies, add true to the result list, else add false to the result list.

4. Return the result list
```

#### __CODE__
```
public List<Boolean> kidsWithCandies(int[] candies, int extraCandies) {
        int max = candies[0];
        for(int i=0;i < candies.length; i++){
            if(max < candies[i]){
                max = candies[i];
            }
        }
        List<Boolean> result = new ArrayList<>(); 
        for(int i=0;i<candies.length;i++){
            int target = candies[i] + extraCandies;
            if(target >= max){
                result.add(true);
            }else{
                result.add(false);
            }
        }
            return result;
    }
