UST GLOBAL: 3-01-2022
=====================
	1. Employee -> attribute city -> sort the employee based on city using Java 8.

	Ans: We can use Collections.groupBy() to group list of employees by city.
	    
	  ::: employeeList.stream()
                .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getCity));	


	2. Employee ->salaries sort the the employees based on salary in decreasing order.

	  :::  employeeList.sort(Comparator.comparingLong(Employee::getSalary));
       	       employeeList.forEach(System.out::println);


	3. Comparable Vs Comparator -> 
		Ans: Single Sort Vs Multiple sort 
		     

	4. CLoning -> Deep and Shalow 

	5. Hash table having null key / null value
		Ans:: Hash Table doesnot allow any null key or null value.

	6. How does Key and value is stored in Hash Map.
	7. What is Tree Map.
 	8. Can we store any object reference as a key in Hash map. If Yes what are the steps.
		Ans:: yes, while implementation we should take care for equals and hashcode contract.i.e For the same object same hashcode should be produced.
		
	9. Differentiate Truncate and Delete.
		Ans:: Rollback mechanism in truncate || Where clause used with delete.

	10. Wait and Sleep method.
	11. Methods in Object class
	13. Union Vs Union all

			Union All extracts all the rows including the duplicates (repeated values) from both the queries.
	14. Concurrent Hash Map
	15. What is serializable
	16. What is Externalization
